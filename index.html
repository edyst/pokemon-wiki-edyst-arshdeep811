            Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon 
            Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken 
            Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing 
            video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers<br><br>

            <p>
              Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three 
              starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. 
              Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and 
              other sea-dwelling creatures.

              Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the 
              three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new 
              players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire 
              variation starter is often a plus.

              is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to

              The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting out 
              their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. 
              A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

              in revenue and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, 
              the game remains incredibly popular.

       <div>
         <ol>
           <li><b>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</b>
             <ul>
               <li>
                 We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of 
                 Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's 
                 evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of 
                 generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either 
                 way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
                </li>
                <li>Answer is Raichu</li>

           <li><b>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, 
                but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild 
                Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached 
                the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot 
                catch, and no button mashing at all is required.

             Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core 
             series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime.
           </p> 
           <p style="color: #8a8a8a;">
             Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type 
             matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly 
             different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly 
             closer in line.

              The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
              created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
              Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
              after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
              Green version was not released outside Japan

              and European release date of April 2001. Like the previous generation, an enhanced version, titled 
              Pokémon Crystal, was later released.
